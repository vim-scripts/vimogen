Vimogen is perhaps the easiest way to install, remove, or update Vim plugins.

Essentially a Pathogen bundle manager that manages the installing/deleting/updating of all your Vim plugins through a shell script that manages git repositories, Vimogen makes it easy to keep all of your Vim plugins synchronized across different machines.

Simply create a manifest file in your home directory called .vimogen_repos (or let vimogen generate one for you) and put git URLs to Vim plugins in it, one line at a time, like:

    git://github.com/tpope/vim-surround.git
    git://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git
    git://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git
    git://github.com/godlygeek/tabular.git
    ...

(Fortunately, all of the plug-ins on vim.org are mirrored on github here: https://github.com/vim-scripts/. And there are even more plug-ins on github.)

Running vimogen will give you the option to install, update, or uninstall the Vim plugins you use.

    1) INSTALL
    2) UNINSTALL
    3) UPDATE
    4) EXIT
    Enter the number of the menu option to perform: 1

If you choose INSTALL, then it will a "git clone" on each of the git repositories that you specified in ~/.vimogen_repos into your Pathogen dir (~/.vim/bundle). It will skip any directories that already exist. You can also append new plugin repos to the .vimogen_repos file later and install them incrementally by re- running Vimogen\\&#039s install command.

If you choose UNINSTALL, it will give you a list of all your plugins to choose from:

    1) EXIT
    2) ctrlp
    3) nerdtree
    4) python-mode
    5) vim-fugitive
    6) vim-surround
    7) ZenCoding
    Enter the number of the plugin you wish to uninstall:

If you choose UPDATE, then it will run a "git pull" on all of your bundles. This is great because you can stay up-to-date with all the new features the plugin authors create just by re-running this command often.
